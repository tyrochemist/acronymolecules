### Create fun molecules by entering any acronym or initialism

This program creates a fictitious molecule name based on an entered sequence of letters, intended to be an initialism or acronym.

```
Input upper case molecular acronym: DMF
D M F
D word is: di
M word is: methyl
F word is: formamide
Your acronym stands for: dimethylformamide
```

Currently, the program does not differentiate between sub-words at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the compound. There is also a limited number of sub-words implemented.

Goals include implementing "beginning", "middle", and "ending" categories for words, as well as expanding the list of potential sub-words.
